## Controllers:

**This section is for standard guitar controls, standard drums, and Xbox 360/Wii Pro Drums.**  
Pro Guitars and/or Keyboards are set up later.

If you're playing with a single instrument controller, consider the [[Instrument Repo]](instrument-repo#readme) which has easy drag and drop profiles for various rhythm game instruments.

If not, keep reading.

**Right click on “Rock Band 3” and select “Create Custom Gamepad Configuration”**

![A screenshot of RPCS3's right click menu, showing "Create Custom Gamepad Configuration" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/TheGreatSplit/assets/images/conf/rpcs3pad.png "Create Custom Gamepad Configuration")

* If you are planning on plugging in multiple instruments, _you must set them on different ports_ (Player 1, Player 2, etc).
* PS3 guitar, drum controllers, and MIDI Pro Adapters **for the Rock Band series** are plug and play and require no additional setup.

**If your controller isn't being detected, click “Refresh”. If that doesn't solve it, restart RPCS3.**

Once you've finished configuring, **remember to click “Save”.**

Below are the buttons you should map in RPCS3's Gamepad Settings.
  
### Guitars:

* If you're using PS2 (Guitar Hero), PS3 (Guitar Hero), or Wii guitars, set the “Handlers” option to “MMJoyStick.” 
* If you're using Xbox 360 guitar controllers, set the “Handlers” option to “XInput.”

Make sure you **set “Device Class” to “Guitar”.**

**Switch the drop-down menu, next to "Device Class", to "Rock Band" if you're using a Rock Band guitar or leave it on “Guitar Hero” if you're using a Guitar Hero guitar**. 
 
**Some guitar controllers** (most notably Guitar Hero controllers) misbehave and **refuse to map sometimes. If you try mapping a button and get “U+”, click “Filter Noise"** at the bottom left of the controller configuration window **then try mapping**.

### Drums:

Make sure you **set “Device Class” to “Drum”.**

* If you're using PS3 (Guitar Hero), Wii, or Xbox 360 drum controllers, set the “Handlers” option to “MMJoyStick.”
* If you're using a Xbox 360 MIDI Pro Adapter for drums, set the "Handlers" option to "XInput."

**Switch the drop-down menu next to it to "Rock Band Pro" if you're using Rock Band drums or Rock Band Drums with Pro expansions. Do **NOT** use the regular "Rock Band" type. Leave it on “Guitar Hero” if you're using Guitar Hero drums.**

### Vocals: 

*For vocals*, you can *use regular controllers*. If you're using an actual PS3 controller, switch "Handlers" to DS3. If you're using a PS4 controller (DualShock 4), switch "Handlers" to DS4. If you're using an Xbox 360, Xbox One, or Xbox Series controller, switch "Handlers" to XInput. There's no need to remap anything. Alternatively, you can use a typing keyboard and refer to this guide to customize the mapping according to your preferences. [[DualShock 3 controllers]](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Controller_Configuration#Using_DualShock_3_controller) and [[DualShock 4 controllers]](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Controller_Configuration#Using_DualShock_4_controller) may require additional setup.

Here's what a _The Beatles: Rock Band Höfner_ Wii controller looks like when it's set up. Note that "Handlers" is set to "MMJoystick" and "Devices" is set to the correct Joystick number. Since it's a Rock Band guitar controller, "Device Class" is also set to "Guitar" and the box next to that is set to "Rock Band."
