## ABOUT:
These are meant for users that quickly want to just start playing with minimal setup. It is still strongly suggested that you do [[custom configuration]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/tree/main#custom-configuration) to tweak to your computer's optimal settings.  
You *MUST* have [[Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe#-installing-on-rpcs3) otherwise these will not work to their full potential.  

To use these, click on the settings you want to download then extract the ZIP archives in the folder where you extracted RPCS3. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.

##### [[Carl settings]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/blob/main/config/customconfig/carlsettings.zip)
These settings are strictly here for me to download due to constant emulator resets due to writing tutorials. These are used daily on an AMD Ryzen 3900x CPU, a NVIDIA GTX 1660 GPU, 32 GBs of 3600 MHz RAM, a Samsung 980 Pro 2 M.2 PCIe x4 NVME SSD, and a Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 interface. I'm strictly keeping these here for my use and suggest you avoid using these.
