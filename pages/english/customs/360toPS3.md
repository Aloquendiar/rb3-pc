At the bottom left, make sure `Encrypt .mid.edat` is enabled, then select between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP. It is **much** faster than PKG creation.
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs.

<p><em>(Optional but highly recommended)</em><br>
With these methods, the USRDIR subfolder will have an auto-generated name. For single songs and packs, it’ll be <code>OxxxxxSongName</code>. However, if you make a pack, the folder name will only include the first song in the pack.<br>
If you want to find the folder easily, it's recommended to select <code>Custom USRDIR subfolder</code> instead of <code>Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack</code> and entering the name of your choice.<br>

<p>You can make a pack with just a single song too. It really helps if you’re trying to locate a song you already installed within the game files.<br>

<p>Navigate to your RPCS3 folder and select the <code>dev_hdd0</code> folder.<br>
