## NOTES

* The bindings have not been verified. If you want to help, please send us a message!
* **Tilt, Whammy, and pickup switch WILL NOT work at all!** Solo buttons may or may not work.
	* If you own a Riffmaster, it's suggested to purchase a solution like [[RetroCultMods' V3 Wii/USB Guitar Adapter]](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1536358024/v3-wii-guitar-adapter-with-tilt-for) or the [[Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_mod_riffada) to have whammy, tilt, and convert it to a multiplatform guitar.
* Latency on Jaguars and Stratocasters may be an issue depending on your Bluetooth receiver. This may make it difficult to calibrate.
* PDP Riffmaster guitars require their respective dongle.
