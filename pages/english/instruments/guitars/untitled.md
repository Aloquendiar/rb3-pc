**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.

It's suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play games that don't use instruments.

Follow the instructions below and match the assignments.

In the example below, a The Beatles: Rock Band HÃ¶fner is being mapped.

If your changes aren't applying, you may have a `Custom Gamepad Configuration` overwriting the main `Pads` configuration.  
Rock Band 3 will have a game controller icon next to it in the game list if you have a `Custom Gamepad Configuration`.

To remove the `Custom Gamepad Configuration` and use the suggested global `Pads` settings,  
right click on Rock Band 3 > `Remove` > `Remove Custom Gamepad Configuration`.

## Using Profiles

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once. </b> {{include.content}}</div>

After downloading the profile,
1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.

After that, you can select the profile in the **"Pads"** menu.

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don't, try changing the controller listed in "`Devices`", next to the "`Refresh`" button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.
