## NOTES

* **NOT A RECOMMENDED CONTROLLER** but kept in this list since it's unlikely many people will have this and since not much documentation exists on this controller.
* Whammy doesn't work, which means a crucial gameplay element doesn't work.
* Tilt does not work. Various things have been attempted to get it to work, but the weird gyroscope configuration does not work well with RPCS3 and constantly inputs garbage.
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_pads){:target="_blank"}.
