## NOTES:

* This controller requires advanced configuration.
* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.

### Additional Setup:
1. Put the Roll Limitless Adapter in firmware updating mode. To do this, press and hold the rectangular button on the top of the adapter, near the micro USB port.  
![A picture of a Roll Limitless adapter, showing the firmware button circled in red.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/rolllimitless/fwbutton.png "Roll Limitless Firmware button")
2. While still holding the button, plug it into your computer. If done successfully, the Roll Limitless will show up as a removable drive.
3. [[Download the latest "Universal" firmware for the Roll Limitless from the official website]](https://rolllimitless.com/firmwares/).
4. Place the firmware file on the Roll Limitless device while it's in firmware updating mode (showing up as a removable drive). When it completes, safely remove the device.
5. Plug the Roll Limitless adapter back into your computer while holding down the round Start button.

6. Verify that Windows has detected the Roll Limitless adapter by searching for `joy.cpl` in the Start menu.

7. If it shows up, it's ready to go. If not, make sure you're plugging it in while holding down the round Start button.
