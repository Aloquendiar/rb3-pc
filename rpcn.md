You will be prompted for an **email address** so you can receive a **verification token**:

You will next be asked to confirm your account's creation. **Click “Yes”**.

Now go to your email inbox to check for your verification token. You may have to wait a few minutes to get it. If you're still waiting, check your spam inbox. The email will be called **“Your token for RPCN.”  
Copy the token**:

**Paste the token** into RPCS3 and click OK:
