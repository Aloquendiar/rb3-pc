## NOTES

* Requires installing and running [[**RB4InstrummentMapper**]](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB4InstrumentMapper/)
* This profile works for Xbox One Fender Stratocaster, Fender Jaguar, and PDP Riffmaster guitars.
	* Fender Stratocaster and Fender Jaguar guitars require a Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter.
	![Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/btns/ctrls/xbox/receiver.png "Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows 10")  
	* PDP Riffmaster guitars require their respective dongle.  
	![PDP Riffmaster Wireless Receiver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/btns/ctrls/xbox/riffrec.png "PDP Riffmaster Wireless Receiver")  
* If you have a Jaguar guitar, you may need to install a [[firmware update]](https://bit.ly/2UHzonU) to connect it to the receiver. [[Click here for more information]](https://bit.ly/2UHzonU).
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a typing keyboard or a gamepad.

## Pad Information

## Additional Setup

Please refer to RB4InstrumentMapper's documentation.  
[[Click here to go there]](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB4InstrumentMapper/blob/main/README.md).

## Mapping:

### Controller Emulation Mode: ViGEmBus (RPCS3 compatibility)

This is the recommended mode and should not require any mapping. You simply need to assign the Handler, Device, and Device Class/Type.

### Controller Emulation Mode: ViGEmBus

[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/main/instrument-repo/Xbox%20One%20Rock%20Band%20Guitar.7z)

This is not suggested as it requires lots of manual mapping. You should instead use **ViGEmBus (RPCS3 compatibility)**.

The effects switch (pickup selector) was only able to be bound to the top half or the bottom half. The bottom half was chosen in the profile so it could be disabled.
