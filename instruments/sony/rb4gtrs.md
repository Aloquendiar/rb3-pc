## NOTES

* **The Rock Band 4 Jaguar and Stratocaster controllers are known for having horrible latency.**
* The Riffmaster will not have functional Whammy or Tilt.
	* It's suggested to purchase a solution like [[RetroCultMods' V3 Wii Guitar Adapter WITH TILT for Clone Hero and RB4 (Rock Band 4)]](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1536358024/v3-wii-guitar-adapter-with-tilt-for) or the [[Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host]](https://carlmylo.github.io/rpcs3guidetesting/instruments/misc/riffada) to have whammy, tilt, and a multiplatform guitar.
* You may experience softlocks when opening up interface menus, like RPCN related ones. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a typing keyboard or a gamepad.

## Mappings

* Tilt can be set up but it is very complicated. You will have have to mess with "Filter Noise" until it catches the tilt accelerometer. It's suggested to not bother with this and not tilt.
	* To bind multiple buttons to one RPCS3 button, hold Shift then click on the RPCS3 button you want to assign multiple buttons to.
* Guitar Hero controllers tend to misbehave and **refuse to map sometimes. If you try mapping a button and always get "U+" or something similar, click "Filter Noise"** at the bottom left of the controller configuration window **then try mapping**.
