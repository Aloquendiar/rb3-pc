**After all of that, remember to click "Apply" then "Save custom configuration"**

If everything seems to be working, **I'd also strongly suggest changing RPCS3's log to only display fatal errors** as it gets flooded by excess messages otherwise.

To do this, **right click in RPCS3's log at the bottom and then left click on "Fatal"**.

![A screenshot of RPCS3's log being right clicked and showing that it has been switched to only log "Fatal" errors.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/TheGreatSplit/assets/images/cust/logging.png "RPCS3 Fatal Logging")

That's the difficult part over with.
