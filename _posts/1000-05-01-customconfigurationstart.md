**Right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on “**Create Custom Configuration From Default Settings**”.

This may seem overwhelming because of the sheer number of options, but I have color-coded the settings that require adjustment. Anything not colored should be left alone.

| COLOR | MEANING |
|---|---|
| ![A green square with a dashed outline.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/TheGreatSplit/assets/images/cust/biggreen.png "Green Square") | **REQUIRED** |
| ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/TheGreatSplit/assets/images/cust/bigblue.png "Blue Square") | **Performance Tweaks** |
| ![A tan square with a solid outline.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/TheGreatSplit/assets/images/cust/bigtan.png "Tan Square") | **Recommended** |

We'll go tab by tab, starting with CPU.
