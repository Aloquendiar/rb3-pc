## I/O
**This section is for people playing with USB/MIDI Keyboards, Pro Guitars, or MIDI Drums!**
* **If you're not playing with a wired Pro Guitar, Pro Drums, or a USB/MIDI keyboard,** [[**skip** over **this section**].](#network)  
* **If you're playing with a PS3 Rock Band 3 Keyboard or wireless PS3 Mustang Pro Guitar,** [[**skip** over **this section**].](#network)  

**If your keyboard has a USB port**, all you need to do is **plug it into your computer**.

**If your keyboard only has a MIDI output, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.

**The same applies to Rock Band 3 Pro Guitars** as they only have MIDI outputs.

Here's an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity. **To check that you've plugged it in correctly, you should see ‚ÄúMIDI In‚Äù blinking when you press a key**.

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs. For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.

**If everything's connected**, let's go ahead and **focus on RPCS3's I/O tab.**
**YOU MAY HAVE TO MAKE THE WINDOW WIDER TO READ THE OPTIONS!**

	* üéπ **Keyboard Players: Leave your "Emulated MIDI type" on "Keyboard" and select your keyboard or MIDI interface in the drop-down menu next to it.**.
	* üé∏ **Pro Guitar Players: Change your "Emulated MIDI type" from "Keyboard" to "Guitar (17 Frets)" if you have a Mustang Pro Guitar, or "Guitar (22 Frets)" if you have a Squier Pro Guitar, then select your MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
	* üé∏ ü•Å **Pro Drums Players: Change your "Emulated MIDI type" from "Keyboard" to "Drums", then select your MIDI Electronic Drum Kit or MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.

Visit the instrument repo if you're using a [[Xbox 360]](https://github.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/tree/main/instrument-repo/Xbox%20360%20Rock%20Band%203%20Keyboard#readme) or a [[Nintendo Wii]](https://github.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/tree/main/instrument-repo/Wii%20Rock%20Band%20Keyboard#readme) Rock Band 3 Keyboard connected via MIDI to USB. Also visit the instrument repo if you're on a [[MIDI Drum Kit]](https://github.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/tree/main/instrument-repo/MIDI%20Drums#readme) and wish to adjust mappings.

* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](images/cust/smallblue.png "Blue Square") **Tweak depending on CPU**: 
	* **Change "Pad Handler Mode" to "Multi-threaded"** if you have a CPU **with more than 12 threads.**
  
 **If your instrument isn't detected in the drop-down menu, click on "Save custom configuration", close the Custom Configuration window, then right click on Rock Band 3 to reopen it. If that doesn't work, restart RPCS3.**  
  
As **keyboards don't have PS3 buttons, the first octave is** reserved **for mapped keys**. Use the picture below as a reference. I **strongly** suggest putting labels on your keyboard to remind you of what each key does along with color ranges. **The** keyboard's **pitch knob should be mapped to the touch strip and modulation wheel and sustain pedal should be mapped to Overdrive deployment.**
