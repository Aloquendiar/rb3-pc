* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlmylo/rb3-pc/TheGreatSplit/assets/images/cust/smallblue.png "Tan Square") **Improved performance, depending on machine**: 
	* **Change "SPU Block Size" to "Mega"** - Ties smaller SPU compiled together, which requiring fewer cores/threads. Drastically speeds up game startup time on certain machines.
	* **Change "Preferred SPU Threads" to "1", "2", "3", or "4"** - May help prevent stutter caused by CPU overloads on systems with fewer cores/threads. **Start at 4 and lower it one by one until it improves**.
	* **Change "Thread Scheduler" to "RPCS3 Scheduler", or "RPCS3 Alternative Scheduler"** - **FOR CPUs WITH 12+ THREADS ONLY!** May help with thread distribution to prevent microstutters.
