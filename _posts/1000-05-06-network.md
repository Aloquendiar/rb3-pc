* ![A green square with a dashed outline.](images/cust/smallgreen.png "Green Square") **REQUIRED**: 
	* **Change the Network Status to “Connected” as highlighted in the picture. If left on “Disconnected,” the game will temporarily freeze when browsing the song library.**
* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **For online multiplayer**: 
	* Tick **"Enable UPNP"** or **forward port 9103 (UDP) in your firewall**.
		* **Don't enable UPNP while port forwarding** as this can cause crashes.
