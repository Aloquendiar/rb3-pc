# BEFORE YOU USE THIS!!!!
*Please have Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed!*

These are *emergency low-spec settings* for a laptop running an AMD E2-1800 APU (1.70 GHz) and 16 GBs of RAM. *This is an extremely not optimal experience and these settings are only here as an experiment.*

These file:
* Disable Anti-aliasing, set ZCULL Accuracy to "Relaxed (Fastest)", Shader Quality to "Low", the Renderer to "OpenGL", and reduce resolution to the point where it may be hard to read busy charts
* Set Network Status to "Connected", configure RPCS3 for GoCentral, connect to RPCN, and enable UPNP
* Set Exclusive Fullscreen Mode to "Prefer borederless fullscreen", and Driver Wake-Up Delay to "40 Âµs"
* Removes venues and menu backgrounds via DX.dta

Drag "config" and "dev_hdd0" into the folder where you extracted RPCS3 to, unless you have changed the emulator configuration.
