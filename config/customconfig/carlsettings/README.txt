# BEFORE YOU USE THIS!!!!
*Please have Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed!*

These settings are strictly here for me to download due to constant emulator resets due to writing tutorials. These are used daily on an AMD Ryzen 3900x CPU, a NVIDIA GTX 1660 GPU, 32 GBs of 3600 MHz RAM, Samsung 980 Pro 2 M.2 PCIe x4 NVME SSD, and Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 interface. I'm strictly keeping these here for my use and suggest you use the recommended specs instead.

These files:
* Set Anisotropic Filtering to "16x", enable "Write Color Buffers" and "VSync", increase Resolution Scale to 150% (1920x1080), and increase Resolution Scale Threshold to 24x24.
* Decrease Audio Buffer Duration to "60 ms"
* Configure the Emulated MIDI Devices to a 17 Fret Protar and a Keyboard
* Sets Pad Handler Mode to "Multi-threaded"
* Set Network Status to "Connected", configure RPCS3 for GoCentral, connect to RPCN, and enable UPNP
* Enable "Debug Console Mode", Set Exclusive Fullscreen Mode to "Prefer borederless fullscreen", and Driver Wake-Up Delay to "20 Âµs"
* Disable "Show trophy popups", "Show PPU Compilation Hint", "Show shader compilation hint", "Use native user interface"
* Enables Debug Mode for "High-Precision Z Buffer"
* Set Venue FPS to "60", enable "High Memory Mode", disable "Motion Blur", "Camera Shake", and "Depth of Field", and sets a custom theme.

Drag "config", "dev_hdd0", and "GuiConfigs" into the folder where you extracted RPCS3 to, unless you have changed the emulator configuration.
