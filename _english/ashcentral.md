## Intro

**If you're not interested in playing online, skip to the [[next section]](https://carlmylo.github.io/rb3-pc/english/1000-07-01-passthroughdevices.html).**

This part of the guide **requires** that you have an [[**RPCN Account**]](https://carlmylo.github.io/rb3-pc/english/1000-03-02-rpcn.html) **and set your [[network configuration]](https://carlmylo.github.io/rb3-pc/english_configuration/1000-05-01-customconfiguration.html#network) to use AshCentral server settings.**

AshCentral is currently hosts the best experience for playing Rock Band 3 online. We'll be going over how to get the most out of your experience and how you can play online.

## Inviting Friends

Before sending or receiving invites, make sure you're online. For that, open the Start menu and press on "Play on AshCentral" to go online.

**Here's where you actually select the friend you want to send an invite to.**

Once your friend accepts the invite, they'll be in your session.
