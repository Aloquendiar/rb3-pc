## NOTES:

<div align="center">

![Platform](platform.png "Platform") 

![Controller](controller.png "Controller") 

![Mapping](mapping.png "Mapping") 

</div>

* The effects switch seems to reset to the middle when it's adjusted, so you'll be locked to flanger.
	* It can be unmapped by removing the Right Stick: Up/Down mappings.
