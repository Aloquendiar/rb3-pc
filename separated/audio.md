* ![A green square with a dashed outline.](images/cust/smallgreen.png "Green Square") **REQUIRED**: 
	* **Enable "Enable Buffering"** - Absolutely required by Rock Band 3. It should be enabled by default but if it's disabled, re-enable it. You should set your global settings to default while you're at it because you should've done that to begin with.
* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](images/cust/smallblue.png "Blue Square") **Tweak depending on audio hardware and CPU**: 
	* **Adjust "Audio Buffer Duration"** depending on system.
		* Lower values give you less audio latency but use more CPU.
		* Higher values give you more audio latency but use less CPU.
		* Vocalists are affected the most by this, as a higher latency creates a distracting echo. Instrument players can use calibration to compensate regardless of audio buffer setting.
		* You can change this while the game is running, but it will require re-calibrating in Rock Band 3's system settings.
	* **Change "Audio Out" to "XAudio2"** - This is only recommended for users on extremely low end machines as it causes weird audio problems overtime. Experiment with this setting to make sure it actually helps on your end. **Most users should stay on Cubeb!**
* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **For Vocalists**: 
	* **Set Microphone type to Standard or Rocksmith**. Standard will allow you to use mics for voice chat and singing. Rocksmith will only work for singing.
	* **Select an input device in "Mic1", "Mic2", and "Mic3"** for vocals. If not playing vocals, Mic1 will be used for voice chat.
	* Once again, keep in mind that playing with framerates higher than 60 may cause issues with vocal detection.
