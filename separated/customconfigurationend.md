## Quick Configuration: Conclusion

**After all of that, remember to click "Apply" then "Save custom configuration"**

If everything seems to be working, **I'd also strongly suggest changing RPCS3's log to only display fatal errors** as it gets flooded by excess messages otherwise.

To do this, **right click in RPCS3's log at the bottom and then left click on "Fatal"**.

That's the difficult part over with.
